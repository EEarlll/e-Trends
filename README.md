# E-Trends

Welcome to E-Trends! This is a personal project that I have created to showcase my skills, share my interests, and provide valuable information to visitors. 

## Technologies Used

- Vite: The website is built using the Vite framework, which provides fast and efficient development and production builds.
- React: I have utilized React, a popular JavaScript library, to create interactive and dynamic components for a seamless user experience.
- Tailwind CSS: The site's styling is powered by Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for easy and flexible styling customization.
- Google Trends Wrapper API: To provide up-to-date and relevant data, I have integrated the Google Trends Wrapper API, which fetches real-time search trends and queries.
- Headless UI: For interactive behavior and smooth user interactions, I have incorporated Headless UI, a powerful toolkit for building accessible and customizable UI components.
- Heroicons: To enhance the visual appeal of the website, I have used Heroicons, a set of free SVG icons designed for use in web projects.
